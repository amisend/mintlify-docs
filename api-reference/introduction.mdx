## Base URL

All requests contain the following base URL:

```

## API Key

Amisend API keys are used to authenticate API requests. You can find your API keys in the [Amisend dashboard](https://amisend.com/api-keys).

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer ami_xxxxxxxxx where ami_xxxxxxxxx is your [API Key](https://amisend.com/api-keys).

```cli
Authorization: Bearer ami_xxxxxxxxx
```
